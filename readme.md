# An Async, Pythonic, OpenWeatherMap Wrapper

‚ö†Ô∏è This is not a functional package, as I don't see a real need for it. If anyone would like it published on PyPi, create an issue. 

## About
**AsyncOWM-py** is, predictably, an async wrapper for "current weather data" from the OpenWeatherMap API written in Python.

## Sample usecase

```py
import asyncio
import os

# This is not a dependency, optional way to load OWM token
from dotenv import find_dotenv, load_dotenv

from AsyncOWM_py import AsyncOWMClient as OwmClient

load_dotenv(find_dotenv())
client = OwmClient(owm_key=os.getenv("OWM"))


async def main():
    norman = await client.city_by_zip(73072)
    # Temps can be returned as float, rounded int, or "pretty" str, which adds the unit and ¬∞ symbol
    # If you don't convert, it simply returns the pretty str
    print("Norman current", float(norman.temp_current)) 
    print("Norman feels like", norman.feels_like)
    print(f"Norman coords {norman.longitude}, {norman.latitude}")
    print("Norman has", norman.weather_description)


asyncio.run(main())
```

```py
Norman current 87.4
Norman feels like 94¬∞F
Norman coords -97.4841, 35.199
Norman has clear sky
```
## TODO
- Wait for PRs üòâ

## Comments on OWM
The OWM api is wonky. The returned data isn't always how you'd expect it and the geo-coordinate lookup function is very finicky.

**The surefire way to lookup a city is by city name.**

*Second best option is by zipcode. City code is also very good but getting your city's code is not so easy.*

## Author's note
This was made as a learning experience, and is my first public package.
